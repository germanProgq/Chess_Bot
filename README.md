## Introduction

This Chess AI project integrates TensorFlow for machine learning and Stockfish, one of the strongest open-source chess engines, to create robust AIs capable of playing and learning chess. Each version uses a different programming language: Python for rapid prototyping and C++ for performance-critical applications.

## Features

- **Neural Network**: Utilizes TensorFlow for Python and a custom-built neural network for C++.
- **Stockfish Integration**: Integrated for both versions to assist in move selection and validation.
- **Self-Play**: AI improves through self-play in both Python and C++ implementations.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Python version incorporates Bahdanau attention mechanism; C++ version focuses on performance enhancements.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs Keras Tuner for Python and manual tuning for C++.
- **Data Management**: Python version automatically saves game data; C++ version manages data for analysis and retraining.

## Installation

## Usage

### Python Usage

#### Playing a Game

To play a game against the AI, run:
```bash
in progress
```

#### Training the AI

To train the AI using self-play and Stockfish, run:
```bash
python bot/chess_bot.py
```

### C++ Usage

#### Playing a Game

To play a game against the AI, run:
```bash
./Chess_Bot_cpp
```

#### Training the AI

Currently in progress...

## Training

### Python Training

The Python training process involves playing multiple games between the AI and Stockfish, collecting data, and using that data to improve the neural network. Key steps include:

1. **Self-Play**: AI plays games against itself or Stockfish to generate training data.
2. **Data Collection**: States, actions, and rewards are saved for each game.
3. **Model Training**: The neural network is trained using the collected data.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated and improved iteratively.

### C++ Training

Training involves iterative improvement using self-play and reinforcement learning techniques.
